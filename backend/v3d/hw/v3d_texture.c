 * broadcom/vulkan) gives a non-MSAA image a DIFFERENT addressing scheme
 * entirely below certain width thresholds:
 *   - width <= utile_w OR height <= utile_h  -> LINEARTILE
 *   - width <= uif_block_w (1 UIF block)     -> UBLINEAR, 1 column

 *   - otherwise                              -> full UIF (XOR/NO_XOR)
 * For RGBA8, uif_block_w = utile_w*2 = 8. v3d_get_uif_pixel_offset's
 * macroblock math is the wrong address function for an image below these
 * width thresholds, scattering texel bytes to the wrong offsets regardless
 * of how much buffer padding surrounds them. v3d_move_tiled_image (v3d_hw.c)
 * has dispatch cases and address functions for LINEARTILE/UBLINEAR_1/
 * UBLINEAR_2 (v3d_get_lt_pixel_offset/
 * v3d_get_ublinear_1_column_pixel_offset/
 * v3d_get_ublinear_2_column_pixel_offset).
 * v3d_texture_level_layout picks the format (stored on the V3DTexture
 * object so v3d_texture_upload_rgba8/_subimage and v3d_texture_emit_state
 * -- called separately, later -- all agree on what was actually used) and
 * pads according to THAT format's own alignment rule, matching MESA's own
 * `align(level_width, X)` calls (each case aligns to a different value,

 *
 *   1. Levels are packed SMALLEST FIRST. The loop runs downward from the last

 *      and afterwards every level shifts up so level 0's OFFSET is 4K-aligned

 *      not from minifying the real one. MESA's v3d_get_dimension_mpad exists
 *      solely for this. The two can disagree for a non-power-of-two size: at
 *      width 12, level 1 is 6, so the padded base is 16 and level 2 is 4 --
 *      not 12 >> 2 = 3.
 *
 * Promotion is a memcpy because level 0's layout does not depend on whether a
 * chain follows it -- same tiling, padded dimensions, stride and size, only
 * the offset moves.
 *
 * Returns 0 on success, -1 if the new allocation fails; the texture is then
 * left exactly as it was (tex->texture_mem and tex->levels[] restored), so the

 * address into a shader-state record (the `texture_base_pointer_rshift_6` field
 * below), and the command list carries only that snapshot -- never a

 *
 * Giving the new contents a FRESH allocation, and letting the already-binned
 * draws keep the old one, fixes that without the GPU ever stalling. It is the
 * standard buffer-renaming answer and it exploits the same property: because
 * the address is a snapshot, the old block stays correct for as long as we
 * decline to free it.
 *
 * WHY NOT SPLIT THE PASS: splitting is also correct, and ruinous for an
 * application that uploads into ONE shared scratch texture and draws
 * immediately, once per surface -- a frame with N such surfaces pays N-1
 * full-screen store/reload cycles with two blocking GPU waits each, against
 * zero stalls for a rename.
 *
 * THE OLD BLOCK CANNOT BE FREED IMMEDIATELY. The command list naming it is
 * submitted at present time and the GPU finishes with it asynchronously, so a
 * FreeVec here would hand the system pool memory the hardware is still reading.
 * Parked blocks are therefore released only once a render wait has actually
 * succeeded -- see v3d_texture_drain_parked and its caller in gl/src/context.c.

     * or below the base level, which is what magnification means and what
     * makes the hardware pick the mag filter. Setting BOTH ends to 1/256 does
     * not work: [1/256, 1/256] is just as unable to reach 0 as [1.0, 1.0].
