/*
 * MiniGLV3D fork of MiniGL/src/context.c, the context-lifecycle layer.
 *
 * Almost every function in the original either opened a Warp3D
 * context/screen/window directly or touched W3D_Context internals
 * (CPFlags/VPFlags/TPFlags, the Vertex Array Pipeline fast-path fields)
 * that have no V3D equivalent. The decisions below are referenced by name
 * from the functions that depend on them:
 *
 * DISPLAY OPENING -- the original had two independent, Warp3D-coupled
 * paths: vid_OpenDisplay (fullscreen, custom screen + AllocScreenBuffer-
 * based double buffering, flipped via ChangeScreenBuffer) and
 * vid_OpenWindow (windowed, AllocBitMap + ClipBlit each frame). This
 * backend has no "swap buffers" primitive: V3D renders directly into the
 * memory of a locked bitmap, at the address and stride LockBitMapTags
 * returns (context->vmembase/bprow).
 *   - vid_OpenDisplay (fullscreen): opens a custom screen in a
 *     PIXFMT_BGRA32 mode of the requested size. Single-buffer mode (the
 *     default) renders into the screen's own bitmap
 *     (screen->RastPort.BitMap). It also opens a borderless backdrop
 *     window on that screen purely for Intuition input (IDCMP) -- the
 *     original did this too (its own vid_OpenDisplay opens a
 *     WFLG_BACKDROP|WFLG_BORDERLESS window even in "fullscreen" mode):
 *     MGLMainLoop (others.c) reads key/mouse events from that window's
 *     UserPort, so without it MGLMainLoop cannot run in fullscreen. The
 *     window is context->inputWindow, separate from context->v3dWindow,
 *     which stays NULL in fullscreen. A LockBitMapTags lock held on the
 *     screen's bitmap for the whole session hangs once that window opens
 *     -- cybergraphics.library forbids library calls while a bitmap is
 *     locked -- so the bitmap is locked per frame instead (see
 *     vid_OpenDisplay's own comment).
 *   - vid_OpenWindow (windowed): opens a window on the default public
 *     screen (LockPubScreen(NULL)), as the original did, and an AllocBitMap
 *     for the drawable area -- 32-bit, unlike the original's 8-bit
 *     offscreen bitmap: V3D writes RGBA8 with no format-conversion step,
 *     so the offscreen target must already be the format V3D writes.
 *     LockBitMapTags on that bitmap gives the same direct-address/stride
 *     access as fullscreen mode. MGLSwitchDisplay copies it into the
 *     window with the original's ClipBlit call (AmigaOS/CGX API, no Warp3D
 *     coupling).
 *   - MGLSwitchDisplay: fullscreen single-buffer mode (the default) has
 *     nothing to do after the present (it already draws directly into the
 *     visible screen bitmap); windowed mode keeps the original's ClipBlit
 *     call.
 *   - Buffers[3]/NumBuffers/BufNr: the buffer count is chosen at runtime
 *     with mglChooseNumberOfBuffers, but every request gets single
 *     buffering unless the library is built with
 *     MGLV3D_DOUBLE_BUFFER_ENABLED=1 (see the newNumberOfBuffers
 *     declaration comment for why). When enabled:
 *     1 (the default) = single buffer, no vsync. 2 or 3 = fullscreen
 *     double buffering with vsync: two AllocScreenBuffer buffers, render
 *     into the back one, wait for the render, then one ChangeScreenBuffer
 *     (the original MiniGL/src/context.c pattern). On this RTG stack that
 *     call itself waits about one refresh, so the frame rate follows the
 *     refresh rate and a frame never tears; 3 buffers would bring nothing
 *     over 2 here, so 3 means 2. mglEnableSync is accepted and has no
 *     effect: the buffer count decides. See vid_OpenDisplay's and
 *     MGLSwitchDisplay's own comments.
 *   - MGLResizeContext: the original had a separate ~170-line
 *     vid_ReopenDisplay that duplicated most of vid_OpenDisplay just to
 *     resize a live screen while preserving the Warp3D context. Here it is
 *     close-then-reopen at the new size, which tears down and rebuilds
 *     both the Amiga screen/window and the backend's V3DContext, whose GPU
 *     memory pools are sized at create/resize time (v3d_context.h).
 *
 * GLClear -- the original's GLClear was Warp3D immediate-mode: lock
 * hardware, W3D_ClearDrawRegion/W3D_ClearZBuffer touch memory directly,
 * unlock. There is no such immediate "clear now" primitive in this
 * tile-based architecture -- clearing is declared as part of a
 * binning+render frame submission (TileRenderingModeCFGClearColorsPart1 /
 * ClearTileBuffers / TileRenderingModeCFGZSClearValues). A full-drawable
 * GLClear records what to clear and gl_FramePresent emits it; see GLClear's
 * own comments.
 *
 * MGLSetState -- the original immediately toggled W3D_SetState booleans
 * (alpha test, blend, texture mapping, fog, depth test, dither, point
 * smooth, perspective). Every W3D_SetState call is dropped; each case
 * updates its GLcontext-level field (AlphaTest_State, Blend_State,
 * Texture2D_State[], CullFace_State, etc.), which others.c's
 * GLGetBooleanv/GLIsEnabled read back and which draw.c reads when it sets
 * up each draw (e.g. Blend_State for the blend enable, Texture2D_State[]
 * for the textured shader variant). Alpha testing, for one, is a SHADER
 * VARIANT choice on V3D (dedicated alpha-test fragment shaders), not a
 * state bit. Two cases also mirror directly into V3DContext fields:
 * GL_ALPHA_TEST -> backend.alpha_test_enable, GL_SCISSOR_TEST ->
 * backend.scissor_enable (fog's equivalent field, backend.fog_enable, is
 * deliberately NOT mirrored here -- fog_Set's sync (fog.c, inlined in
 * draw.c) owns that field, and a second writer would serve no purpose).
 * MGL_PERSPECTIVE_MAPPING had no stored state at all even in the original
 * (pure immediate W3D_SetState, nothing to query back) -- a no-op here,
 * kept as an explicit empty case.
 *
 * GLScissor -- the original wrote to TWO different destinations depending
 * on whether scissor testing was CURRENTLY enabled: an immediate
 * W3D_SetScissor call when enabled, or a stashed "restore-to-this-when-
 * disabled" rect when disabled (MGLSetState's GL_SCISSOR_TEST case restored
 * that stash on disable). Here draw.c's per-draw ClipWindow packet reads
 * backend.scissor_x/y/w/h *and* backend.scissor_enable together -- with
 * scissor_enable off it uses the viewport rectangle alone -- so GLScissor
 * writes backend.scissor_x/y/w/h regardless of the current enable state. The Y-flip uses `context->backend.height` (the
 * render-target height V3D was sized to, via v3d_context_init) instead of
 * the original's `context->w3dWindow->Height`, so GLScissor is correct in
 * every display mode and does not depend on a window existing at all.
 *
 * MGLInitContext -- the original's Warp3D-typed initialisation is replaced
 * as follows:
 *  (1) w3dTexBuffer/w3dTexMemory allocation -> textureObjects allocation
 *      (context.h's rename; w3dTexMemory has no analog, dropped).
 *  (2) context->w3dFog.fog_start/end/density/fog_color.r/g/b (W3D_Fog-typed)
 *      -> context->backend.fog_start/end/density/fog_r/g/b (matches fog.c's
 *      own field mapping).
 *  (3) The "Vertex Array Pipeline" block (context->w3dContext->CPFlags/
 *      VPFlags/TPFlags/TPVOffs, context->ArrayPointer.colormode/vertexmode
 *      using W3D_COLOR_FLOAT/W3D_CMODE_RGBA/W3D_VERTEX_F_F_D) configured
 *      Warp3D's OWN vertex-array hardware acceleration fast path -- V3D's
 *      native equivalent is the attribute-record assembly
 *      (VertexArrayPrims/glShaderStateAttributeRecord), architecturally
 *      different. The CPFlags/VPFlags/TPFlags/TPVOffs lines (literal
 *      W3D_Context field writes) are dropped entirely -- no such struct
 *      exists here. The plain pointer/stride fields
 *      (ArrayPointer.colors/texcoords/verts) ARE ported, using the
 *      corrected MGLVertex_t field paths: `.color` (top-level field, not
 *      `.v.color`) and `.v.u0`/`.v.v0` (not `.v.u`/`.v.v`).
 *
 * GLDepthFunc -- GL_NEVER..GL_ALWAYS map onto the V3D_Z_* IDs
 * (backend/include/v3d_context.h), stored in backend.zmode; see that
 * enum's own comment for how the draw path consumes it.
 *
 * GLDepthMask/GLClearColor/GLClearDepth -- pure state, stored in
 * GLcontext_t fields; the original's W3D_SetState call (GLDepthMask) and
 * W3D_Double cast (GLClearDepth) are dropped.
 *
 * MGLLockDisplay/MGLUnlockDisplay/MGLLockBack/MGLLockMode -- Warp3D's
 * "lock hardware, get a direct framebuffer pointer, unlock" model doesn't
 * exist in this backend (the only hardware-touching primitive is submitting
 * a whole binning/render CL -- see GLClear above). These are state-only
 * stubs with no hardware call; MGLLockDisplay/MGLUnlockDisplay/MGLLockBack
 * still track context->v3dLocked. MGLLockBack's MGLLockInfo
 * (width/height/pixel_format/base_address/pitch) is filled from
 * context->backend.width/height and context->vmembase/bprow instead of
 * W3D_Context's fields -- format is always RGBA8 (V3D has one fixed
 * format, no negotiation, matching context.h's own w3dFormat-dropped
 * rationale).
 *
 * mglGetSupportedScreenModes / MGLCreateContextFromID -- in the original,
 * mglGetSupportedScreenModes is built on Warp3D's own screen-mode
 * enumeration API (W3D_GetScreenmodeList / W3D_ScreenMode), which has no
 * V3D equivalent (V3D isn't a Warp3D driver, it doesn't register mode
 * lists with one), and MGLCreateContextFromID opens a Warp3D context on a
 * mode ID from that list. Both are stubs here rather than an AmigaOS-native mode-enumeration
 * replacement. MGLCreateContext (the explicit-w/h constructor) is fully
 * ported.

 *    IndexedPrimList in between this and the eventual FLUSH). GLClear calls
 *    this to guarantee a frame exists and then records what it wants
 *    cleared; draw.c's terminal functions call it too, for the same reason.
 *  - gl_FramePresent (further down this file): the "flush and submit" step,
 *    called from MGLSwitchDisplay -- finalizes binning (FLUSH), builds the
 *    INDIRECT+RENDER lists (consuming the recorded clear values plus
 *    whatever draw calls have appended to the binning list since
 *    gl_FrameBegin), submits both, waits for the binning, and clears
 *    frame_active.

 *
 * THE CPU ONLY EVER READS MEMORY WRAPPED BY ITS OWN CachePreDMA/CachePostDMA.
 * The exec rule for a device that WRITES memory: clear the caches with
 * CachePreDMA before the write, flush them again with
 * CachePostDMA after it. Normal rendering needs neither -- nothing on the CPU
 * reads the screen -- so the pair lives here, around a pass this function
 * runs itself, and every read comes from that pass's scratch output:
 *   - frame in progress: the split pass renders it into scratch;
 *   - no frame in progress (after a swap, before any frame): a pass of its
 *     own that only loads the render target and stores it into scratch, and
 *     is discarded again by MGLReadbackEnd -- the next swap does no extra
 *     work.
 * A read straight from the render target after a swap can return 64-byte
 * blocks of the previous frame, so reading the render target directly is only
 * the fallback below.

 * On return *base points at the top row of a width*height framebuffer in the

 * bytes per row). MGLReadbackEnd must always be called afterwards. A non-NULL
 * *lock means the fallback path, and no library call may happen before
 * MGLReadbackEnd (cybergraphics: the address is only valid inside the lock).
