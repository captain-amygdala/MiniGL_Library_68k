/*
 * MiniGLV3D fork of MiniGL/src/texture.c.
 *
 * FORMAT CONVERSION. The original converted GL pixel data into 16-bit
 * Warp3D texture formats (`context->w3dFormat`/`w3dAlphaFormat`, R5G6B5/
 * A4R4G4B4); that is what `MGLConvert` and its conversion routines
 * (`SHORT565_565`, `RGBA_ARGB`, `INDEX_RGB`, ...) and the `ARGBFORM`/
 * `RGBFORM` packing macros were for. This driver stores every texture as
 * RGBA8 (4 bytes/pixel), so none of that is ported. Instead
 * `tex_GLFormatToSrcFmt` below maps a GL (format, type) pair onto a
 * backend-local `V3D_SRCFMT_*` ID, and a row-stride loop calls
 * `v3d_texture_convert_row` (`backend/hw/v3d_texture.c`), which converts
 * that source format into RGBA8:
 *   - `GL_RGBA`+`GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE` -> `V3D_SRCFMT_RGBA8` (R,G,B,A byte
 *     order, the order the texture stores).
 *   - `GL_RGB`+`GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE` -> `V3D_SRCFMT_RGB8` (R,G,B, alpha forced
 *     0xff by the backend function).
 *   - `GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA` -> `V3D_SRCFMT_LA8` (L,A byte order).
 *   - `MGL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5` -> `V3D_SRCFMT_RGB565` (R5G6B5 from MSB,
 *     the same bit layout as the original's `RGBFORM` macro).
 *   - `MGL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_4_4_4_4` -> `V3D_SRCFMT_ARGB4` (A4R4G4B4 from
 *     MSB, the same layout as the original's `ARGBFORM` macro).
 *   - `GL_COLOR_INDEX` -- not a `V3D_SRCFMT_*`: the V3D TMU has no palette
 *     hardware, so an indexed image is expanded to RGBA8 on the CPU during
 *     upload, through the palette `GLColorTable` keeps in the GL context.
 *     See `TEX_SRCFMT_COLOR_INDEX8` and `tex_BuildPaletteLUT` below.
 *   - `GL_LUMINANCE` -> `V3D_SRCFMT_L8`, `GL_ALPHA` -> `V3D_SRCFMT_A8`
 *     (one byte per texel, expanded by the backend to (L,L,L,1) and
 *     (1,1,1,A) -- RGB passes through an ALPHA texture's MODULATE, as in
 *     GL's base-format table and the original MiniGL's own A8_ARGB
 *     conversion). The original's support for these was indirect, through
 *     A4R4G4B4, as its "Surgeon" comment says.
 * `V3D_SRCFMT_ARGB8`/`_ARGB1555` are not reachable from any GL entry point
 * here, like `V3D_TEXWRAP_BORDER` (the backend value exists, no GL
 * combination reaches it).
 *
 * OBJECT MODEL. The original's `w3dTexBuffer[]`/`w3dTexMemory[]` (parallel
 * GPU-handle and CPU-mirror arrays) become `context->textureObjects[]`, a
 * `V3DTexture**` with one pointer per GL texture name, `malloc`'d on the
 * first `glTexImage2D` for that name (the original's own "create on first
 * use" pattern). No CPU-side mirror is kept the way `w3dTexMemory` was:
 * `V3DTexture.texture_mem` holds the uploaded data in GPU memory, and every
 * upload works from the caller's own `pixels` argument, so a mirror would
 * add nothing. The original's sub-image update rewrote a sub-rectangle of
 * that mirror in place; GLTexSubImage2DNoMIP instead writes the box
 * straight into the texture's tiled GPU memory (`v3d_store_tiled_image`'s
 * tiling, not a flat buffer). `tex_FreeTextures` (called from `context.c`'s
 * `vid_CloseDisplay`/`vid_CloseWindow`) frees each `V3DTexture` with
 * `v3d_texture_free` + `free()`, in place of
 * `W3D_FreeTexObj`+`W3D_FreeAllTexObj`.
 *
 * `tex_SetEnv`/`tex_SetFilter`/`tex_SetWrap` -- the original made immediate
 * `W3D_Set*` hardware calls. Here they write the bound `V3DTexture`'s
 * `texenv_mode` (`V3D_TEXENV_*`, `v3d_texture.h`), `min_filter`/
 * `mag_filter`/`mip_filter_nearest` and `wrap_s`/`wrap_t` fields;
 * `v3d_texture_emit_state` reads filter and wrap off the object when it
 * builds the texture's state records.
 *
 * `tex_ConvertTexture` (the original's "reformat this texture to gain an
 * alpha channel for additive-blend emulation" helper) is not ported: RGBA8
 * always has an alpha channel, so there is nothing to convert to.
 *
 * `tex_Alloc`/`tex_Free`/`tex_Statistic`/`MGLTexMemStat` are the original's
 * small CPU allocator with byte accounting, unchanged; this file uses it for
 * the RGBA8 conversion scratch buffer.

/*
 * MID-FRAME TEXTURE REUSE HAZARD.
 *
 * THE BUG. This is a tile renderer. A draw call is BINNED carrying the
 * texture's address, and the texels are not read until the pass actually
 * renders, at present time. So overwriting a texture between two draws of the
 * same pass retroactively changes what the EARLIER draw samples:
 *
 *     bind T; TexSubImage(A); draw left;  TexSubImage(B); draw right; present
 *
 * renders B on BOTH sides.
 *
 * A glFinish issued by the application (GLFinish, vertexbuffer_min.c) is no
 * substitute for this check: an application may use no barrier at all and must
 * still come out right.
 *
 * THE FIX. Give the texture a fresh allocation and park the old one before the
 * new texels land, so the already-binned draws still sample the OLD contents
 * (see the rename below). If that fails, split the render pass instead, which
 * renders those draws before the overwrite. The split machinery is
 * load-bearing for two other features -- a mid-frame glClear and glReadPixels
 * (MGLReadbackBegin, context.c) both do exactly this. It finalizes the
 * in-progress pass into scratch_color_mem and composites it back on the next
 * pass's tile load, so nothing is lost and the screen never flickers.
 *
 * THE REGRESSION TRAP, and why the stamp exists at all. Acting on EVERY
 * mid-frame upload would punish an application that uploads lightmaps
 * mid-frame, every frame. This therefore fires only when the texture about to
 * be modified was ALREADY DRAWN in the current bin generation: an upload that
 * precedes every draw of that texture in the frame never trips it, while
 * overwriting one already drawn does.
 * A texture uploaded with unit 1 active resolves through VirtualBinding
 * -- the callers already do that, and the stamp in draw.c covers both units,
 * so the two halves agree.
 *
 * CALLED BEFORE ANY ALLOCATION OR UPLOAD WORK, which matters for more than
 * tidiness: glTexImage2D at a NEW SIZE frees the old block outright
 * (`v3d_texture_free` before `v3d_texture_alloc`), and the mip-chain promotion
 * moves level 0 into a fresh allocation and parks the old block -- freeing it
 * outright if the park list is full. Either way a binned draw can be left
 * pointing at memory already returned to the system pool -- the freed-memory
 * variant of the same bug, and worse than reading stale texels. The new-size
 * path also runs v3d_texture_alloc's memset, which would WIPE the stamp before
 * it could be read. Checking first covers all three.
 *
 * The copy entry points need no call of their own: tex_UploadCopiedRect
 * deliberately re-enters the public GLTexImage2D/GLTexSubImage2D, so they
 * inherit this.

 *    atlas uploads would have this scratch buffer -- which is always tightly
 *    packed -- read at the wrong offset and stride. They are saved, defaulted
 *    and restored around the upload.
 *
 * 2. GL's x,y are BOTTOM-origin window coordinates. The readback
 *    (mgl_ReadPixelsTightRGB, others.c -- GLReadPixels' own conversion with
 *    the caller's PACK state ignored, because this scratch is always tightly
 *    packed) takes them as GL does, so they pass straight through. The read
 *    also includes everything drawn so far this frame, like glReadPixels
 *    itself -- GL copies from the framebuffer as it stands.
 *
 * 3. A rectangle reaching outside the framebuffer leaves the readback's
 *    output untouched, so the scratch is cleared first: GL leaves those
 *    texels undefined, and undefined heap is worse than black.
 *
 * The copy reads GL_RGB, so the texels are opaque: that source format fills
 * alpha with 255.

/* Builds context->PaletteData, the palette GL_COLOR_INDEX uploads expand

 *
 * WHAT IS STORED: four bytes per entry, R,G,B,A, already in the form the
 * texel takes, so tex_BuildPaletteLUT has one layout to read. GL's two
 * conversions are applied here, once per entry:
 *  - the source group to RGBA, a missing component taking GL's default (R, G
 *    and B 0, A 1): GL_LUMINANCE is (L,L,L,1), GL_ALPHA (0,0,0,A), GL_RED
 *    (R,0,0,1), and so on;
 *  - RGBA to the base internal format: luminance and intensity keep R,
 *    alpha keeps A, RGB drops A.
 * The texel is then the form this driver's direct uploads give that base
 * format: luminance (L,L,L,1), luminance-alpha (L,L,L,A), intensity
 * (I,I,I,I), and alpha (1,1,1,A), as a GL_ALPHA upload expands.
 *
 * Every argument that selects a layout -- target, internalformat, format,
 * type and width -- is checked before PaletteData, PaletteFormat or
 * PaletteSize changes, so a refused call cannot leave the recorded format
 * and size describing bytes that were never written. PaletteFormat records the base
 * internal format.
 *
 * KNOWN DEVIATION FROM THE GL SPEC, deliberately left alone: for
 * `format` == GL_RGBA this reads the source as A,R,G,B, whereas GL defines
 * GL_RGBA as R,G,B,A. It is MiniGL's own convention -- the original reads a
 * GL_RGBA source as A,R,G,B too -- and changing it would silently alter the
 * meaning of existing callers' palettes rather than fix anything they
 * currently rely on. Worth revisiting only alongside a consumer that actually
 * needs spec behaviour. */
