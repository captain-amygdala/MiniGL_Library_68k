/*
 * MiniGLV3D fork of MiniGL/src/draw.c.
 *
 * Every terminal draw function in the original ends in an immediate-mode
 * Warp3D call (W3D_DrawTriangle/W3D_DrawTriFanV/W3D_DrawArray/etc -- one
 * call rasterizes one primitive RIGHT NOW). V3D has no equivalent: it's
 * tile-based, geometry must be BINNED across a whole frame's worth of
 * draw calls, then RENDERED once at the end. See
 * context.c's own header comment (gl_FrameBegin/gl_FramePresent) for the
 * frame-accumulation architecture this file's terminal functions plug
 * into: gl_FrameBegin (context.c, extern here) guarantees a frame is
 * being accumulated; MGLSwitchDisplay (context.c) is what actually
 * submits, later, once the whole frame -- however many draw calls -- has
 * been appended to the binning list.
 *
 * VERTEX PIPELINE
 *
 * The original's v_ToScreen did a FULL CPU-side perspective-divide +
 * viewport-scale, producing literal screen-pixel coordinates -- because
 * Warp3D's immediate-mode rasterizer expected already-transformed,
 * already-screen-space vertices (it did no transform of its own).
 * V3D's vertex/coordinate shaders are NOT that kind of rasterizer target
 * -- their own QPU instructions (`x_p = x_s / w_s * scale_p * 0.5 *
 * 256.0`, see backend/hw/v3d_assembler.c's g_vertex_shader_assembly/
 * g_coordinate_shader_assembly) take RAW OBJECT-SPACE position, multiply
 * by a uniform 4x4 matrix to get clip-space (x_s/y_s/w_s), THEN do the
 * perspective-divide+scale themselves, on the GPU. Feeding these shaders
 * v_ToScreen's already-divided-and-scaled output would double-apply that
 * math and produce garbage.
 *
 * So: v_ToScreen is not ported at all. Instead, the emitters below feed
 * the shader RAW OBJECT-SPACE vertex data -- captured by
 * vertexbuffer_min.c's GLVertex4f into `.v.x/y/z/w` (V3DVertex's own
 * fields) at glVertex-call time -- plus the current
 * context->CombinedMatrix (MiniGL's own ModelView*Projection combined
 * matrix, matrix.c) as the shader's uniform matrix. The mapping from
 * CombinedMatrix's OF_11..OF_44 access (matrix.h) onto the shader
 * uniform's M_00..M_33 naming (v3d_my_uniforms, below) is derived in
 * gl_EmitPrimitiveV3DEx's own uniform-setup comment.
 *
 * gl_EmitPrimitiveV3D's use_clip_space parameter is the exception: with
 * it set, the emitter reads `.bx/.by/.bz` (clip-space) instead of
 * `.v.x/y/z` and feeds an IDENTITY matrix instead of
 * context->CombinedMatrix -- the position is already transformed, so
 * transforming it again would double-apply the matrix. dh_DrawPoly/
 * dh_DrawLine (hclip.c's two terminal calls) use this path for vertices
 * that only exist as clip-space interpolation results and have no
 * object-space value to hand the shader otherwise.
 *
 * v3d_my_uniforms/byteswap64/g_default_values_buff -- duplicated here
 * rather than shared; there is no backend header that declares them.
