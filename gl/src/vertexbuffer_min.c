/*
 * MiniGLV3D fork of part of MiniGL/src/vertexbuffer.c; that file's
 * GLDepthRange and GLViewport are in viewport.c. The plain (non-USE_MGLAPI)
 * glVertex3f()/glColor3f() macros in gl.h call the GLVertex* and GLColor*
 * functions here.
 *
 * GLBegin picks the d_Draw* function (draw.c) for the primitive. GL_QUADS
 * and GL_QUAD_STRIP need no decomposition here: d_DrawQuads and
 * d_DrawQuadStrip draw each quad as a V3D_PRIM_TRIANGLEFAN. GL_POLYGON
 * reuses d_DrawTriangleFan (a convex polygon triangulates the same way as a
 * fan from vertex 0; see its case label below). GL_LINE_STRIP and
 * GL_LINE_LOOP have their own implementations (d_DrawLineStrip/
 * d_DrawLineLoop), although the original maps both to an empty
 * d_DrawLineStrip. A mode GLBegin has no case for is flagged
 * GL_INVALID_OPERATION. Through CurrentDraw, GL_TRIANGLES always draws
 * with d_DrawTriangles: the original's switch in GLEnd to a vertex-array
 * path (d_DrawTrianglesVA) for large batches is not ported.
 *
 * GLVertex4f and its variants write the raw, untransformed input into
 * `.v.x/.v.y/.v.z/.v.w`. That is what draw.c feeds V3D's vertex/coordinate
 * shaders, which take raw object-space input plus a uniform matrix (see the
 * QPU assembly in backend/hw/v3d_assembler.c and draw.c's header comment).
 *
 * The glColor* family also mirrors the current colour into
 * context->backend.fixed_color (packed RGBA), which draw.c's shader-uniform
 * code reads as the current flat colour. The float variants clamp every
 * component to [0,1] under CLAMP_COLORS (defined in config.h), as the
 * original does:
 * fixed_color packs each component as (v3d_u32)(c * 255.0f) with no
 * masking, so an out-of-range component spills into the neighbouring byte
 * (blue 2.0 gives 0x01FE0000) and 1.005 leaves 0x00 in its own byte. The
 * ubyte variants skip the clamp, as the original does: a ubyte is always in
 * range. They share SetCurrentColor with GLColor4f rather than duplicating
 * its CurrentColor/fixed_color logic.
